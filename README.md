# Introduction
This project takes an export.xml file from qradar, parses it and creates markdown files based on jinja templates

# Getting Started

1. Installation Process
    Nothing needed, the beauty of ronning on docker containers
    VSCode should give you a pop-up that a devcontainer was detected, if that's not the case: `Ctrl + Shift + P` > Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container

2. Software Dependencies
    * Docker
    * VSCode with docker remote containers plugin

# Build and Test
The Project contains a launch.json to run and debug the python code, tests are on the roadmap *ahem*

# Contribute

Feel free to send a PR! My python code may be a bit flaky, so always up for some constructive feedback ;)
