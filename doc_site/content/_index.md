## Introduction

A Security Operations Center (SOC) has a central role in protecting against, and dealing with
cyberattacks. In the ever changing landscape of cyber security, there are many threats to
protect against. Each of these threats can have unique indicators in different parts of the
cyber killchain. It is the job of the SOC to recognize the cyber threats facing the
organization in an early stage, mount the appropriate response and help to adjust security
parameters to avoid breaches. This process of monitoring for manifestations of cyber threats
is called security monitoring.
